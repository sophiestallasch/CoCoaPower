  abstract = {This article examines how controlling statistically for baseline covariates, especially pretests, improves the precision of studies that randomize schools to measure the impacts of educational interventions on student achievement. Empirical findings from five urban school districts indicate that (1) pretests can reduce the number of randomized schools needed for a given level of precision to about half of what would be needed otherwise for elementary schools, one fifth for middle schools, and one tenth for high schools, and (2) school-level pretests are as effective in this regard as student-level pretests. Furthermore, the precision-enhancing power of pretests (3) declines only slightly as the number of years between the pretest and posttests increases; (4) improves only slightly with pretests for more than 1 baseline year; and (5) is substantial, even when the pretest differs from the posttest. The article compares these findings with past research and presents an approach for quantifying their uncertainty.},

  abstract = {There is a strong need for reliable evidence about which educational interventions work in preschool to foster children’s cognitive and socio-emotional learning (SEL) outcomes. Lab-based individually randomized experiments can develop and refine such interventions, and field-based randomized experiments (e.g., cluster randomized trials) evaluate their effectiveness in real-world daycare center settings. Applying reliable estimates of design parameters in the context of a priori power analyses is highly recommended to guarantee that the sample size of these studies is adequate to detect the intervention effect if it exists. However, there is little information on relevant design parameters with preschool children. We therefore took advantage of a systematic collection of individual participant data from four German large-scale samples (554 ≤ N ≤ 2928) with preschool children (aged two to six years) to estimate and meta-analyze single-level (non-clustered lab-based data), two-level (children nested in daycare centers), and three-level (children nested in groups, with groups nested in daycare centers) design parameters for cognitive and SEL outcomes assessed with three methods (standardized tests; parent ratings; educator ratings). The design parameters depict between-group and -center differences as well as the proportion of variance in the outcomes explained by different covariate sets (socio-demographic characteristics, baseline measures, and their combination) at the child, group, and center level. In conclusion, the present paper provides a rich source of design parameters, recommendations, and illustrations to support power analyses and sample size planning of lab- and field-based randomized intervention studies with preschool children.},

  abstract = {Objectives:               Cluster randomised trials, in which groups of individuals are randomised, are increasingly being used in the health field. Adopting a clustered approach has implications for the design of such trials, and sample size calculations need to be inflated to accommodate for the clustering effect. Reliable estimates of intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) are required for robust sample size calculations to be made; however, little empirical evidence is available on their likely size, and on factors which influence their magnitude. The aim of this study was to generate empirical estimates of ICCs and to explore factors which may affect their magnitude.                                         Methods:               Empirical estimates of ICCs were calculated for both process variables and patient outcomes from a number of datasets of primary and secondary care implementation studies.                                         Results:               Estimates of ICCs varied according to setting and type of outcome. Estimates of ICCs for process variables were higher than those for patient outcomes, and estimates derived from secondary care were higher than those from primary care. ICCs for process variables in primary care were of the order of 0.05–0.15, whilst those in secondary care were of the order of 0.3. Estimates for patient outcomes in primary care were generally lower than 0.05.                                         Conclusions:               Adopting cluster randomisation has implications for the design, size and analysis of clinical trials. This study gives an insight into the potential size of ICCs in primary and secondary care, and provides a practical guide to researchers to aid the planning of future studies in this area.},

Further, it discusses some of the most relevant challenges facing the development of evidence-informed education policies in Europe.                                         Design/Approach/Methods:               This article analyzes official documents by the European Commission (EC) and other organizations. Literature in the field of evidence-based education worldwide is examined to identify the primary challenges and issues related to the development of a culture of evidence in Europe’s education sector.                                         Findings:               The EC has recently prioritized evidence-informed policy and practice in education, increasingly encouraging member states to utilize evidence in the policy decision-making process. According to official documents, this process began in 2006 and has since enjoyed remarkable progress through several initiatives intended to spread a culture of evidence in education. However, several challenges and issues remain regarding the promotion of evidence-informed policymaking.                                         Originality/Value:               Having prioritized evidence-informed policy and practice, the EC strongly encourages the adoption of evidence in the policymaking process. This article provides a point of reference regarding the initiatives already undertaken and the challenges facing evidence-based educational policies and policymaking in Europe.},

Embedded in psychometric heuristics, we analyzed (a) covariate types of varying bandwidth-fidelity, namely domain-identical (IP), cross-domain (CP), and fluid intelligence (Gf) pretests, as well as sociodemographic characteristics (SC); (b) covariate combinations quantifying incremental validities of CP, Gf, and/or SC beyond IP; and (c) covariate time lags of 1–7~years, testing validity degradation in IP, CP, and Gf. Estimates from six German samples (1868\,≤\,N\,≤\,10,543) covering various outcome domains across grades 1–12 were meta-analyzed and included in precision simulations. Results varied widely by grade level, domain, and hierarchical level. In general, IP outperformed CP, which slightly outperformed Gf and SC. Benefits from coupling IP with CP, Gf, and/or SC were small. IP appeared most affected by temporal validity decay.

Establishing a robust knowledge base on how to promote student achievement requires sensitive RT designs demonstrating sufficient statistical power and precision to draw conclusive and correct inferences on the effectiveness of educational programs and innovations. Proper power analysis is therefore an integral component of any informative RT on student achievement. This venture critically hinges on the availability of reasonable input variance design parameters (and their inherent uncertainties) that optimally reflect the realities around the prospective RT—precisely, its target population and outcome, possibly applied covariates, the concrete design as well as the planned analysis. However, existing compilations in this vein show far-reaching shortcomings. The overarching endeavor of the present doctoral thesis was to substantively expand available resources devoted to tweak the planning of RTs evaluating educational interventions. At the core of this thesis is a systematic analysis of design parameters for student achievement, generating reliable and versatile compendia and developing thorough guidance to support apt power analysis to design strong RTs. To this end, the thesis at hand bundles two complementary studies which capitalize on rich data of several national probability samples from major German longitudinal large-scale assessments. Study I applied two- and three-level latent (covariate) modeling to analyze design parameters for a wide spectrum of mathematical-scientific, verbal, and domain-general achievement outcomes. Three vital covariate sets were covered comprising (a) pretests, (b) sociodemographic characteristics, and (c) their combination. The accumulated estimates were additionally summarized in terms of normative distributions. Study II specified (manifest) single-, two-, and three-level models and referred to influential psychometric heuristics to analyze design parameters and develop concise selection guidelines for covariate (a) types of varying bandwidth-fidelity (domain-identical, cross-domain, fluid intelligence pretests; sociodemographic characteristics), (b) combinations quantifying incremental validities, and (c) time lags of 1- to 7-year-lagged pretests scrutinizing validity degradation. The estimates for various mathematical-scientific and verbal achievement outcomes were meta-analytically integrated and employed in precision simulations. In doing so, Studies I and II addressed essential gaps identified in previous repertoires in six major dimensions: Taken together, this thesis accumulated novel design parameters and deliberate guidance for RT power analysis (1) tailored to four German student (sub)populations across the entire school career from Grade 1 to 12, (2) matched to 21 achievement (sub)domains, (3) adjusted for 11 covariate sets enriched by empirically supported guidelines, (4) adapted to six RT designs, (5) suitable for latent and manifest analysis models, (6) which were cataloged along with quantifications of their associated uncertainties. These resources are complemented by a plethora of illustrative application examples to gently direct psychological and educational researchers through pivotal steps in the process of RT design. The striking heterogeneity of the design parameter estimates across all these dimensions constitutes the overall, joint key result of Studies I and II. Hence, this work convincingly reinforces calls for a close match between design parameters and the specific peculiarities of the target RT’s research context. All in all, the present doctoral thesis offers a—so far unique—nuanced and extensive toolkit to optimize power analysis for sound RTs on student achievement in the German (and similar) school context. It is of utmost importance that research does not tire to spawn robust evidence on what actually works to improve schooling. With this in mind, I hope that the emerging compendia and guidance contribute to the quality and rigor of our randomized experiments in psychology and education.}
